# Image Grid

This implementation is designed to efficiently load and display images in an asynchronous manner within a scrollable grid view. By utilizing asynchronous loading techniques, the system ensures that the UI remains responsive and free from any lag or freezing during user interaction. This approach enhances the user experience by providing a smooth scrolling experience even while heavy image data is being fetched and rendered on the fly.
